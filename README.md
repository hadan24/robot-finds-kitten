# Modded Robot Finds Kitten
## Dan Ha
My first homework project for _CS 410 Computer Game Design_ at
Portland State University, taught by Dr. Bart Massey.

## What the project is
A remaking of the classic _Robot Finds Kitten_ (RFK) game
targeting an entirely different player experience.

## Design Questions
1. With my changes to RFK, I want to create a more challenging
	puzzle/strategy game-like experience where finding the kitten
	is hard enough that the	player may not be able to do it every
	round unless they play well. I want to encourage minimalist
	pathing between objects	and finding the kitten as fast as
	possible, turning this into more of a puzzle-/strategy-like
	game in terms of finding that minimal path.

2. My objects, symbols will be marked `thusly`:
	* Battery `I` - consume to immediately regain a random, small percentage of battery life
	* Portable Charger `d` - the next few steps (random amount) cost no battery life
	* Wall `@` - multi-space, blocks path
	* Wall socket `:` - interact for multiple turns to recharge as much as desired
	* Enhanced parts `8` - can interact with objects from further away (can stack)

3. Each step or every few steps costs some battery life, and the robot
	must find the kitten before running completely out.

4.

6. 

7. My "AAA" version would include more potential items to interact
	with and thus more ways to obstruct or help the player. Since I
	have been on a modern roguelike kick with Supergiant's _Hades_,
	It could include multiple randomly generated levels, in which
	objects spawn at different rates to vary the difficulty. Another
	possible route would be to have hand-crafted levels to take this
	more into a puzzle-like direction.
